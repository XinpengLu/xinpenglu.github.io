Here is **Xinpeng Lu (陆新蓬)**. 

I am currently pursuing my master’s degree in Computer Technology at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/), having been recommended for direct admission without the entrance exam. I am advised by [Prof. Houqiang Li (李厚强)](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~lihq/) and [Prof. Wengang Zhou (周文罡)](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~zhwg/index.html). 

I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from [College of Information Engineering](http://xxgcxy.yzu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Yangzhou University](https://www.yzu.edu.cn/), where I was advised by [Prof. Junwu Zhu (朱俊武)](https://xxgcxy.yzu.edu.cn/info/1020/7295.htm).
